# The Reason

**Everything in this part, was written in ENGLISH.**  
Why? A skill test of my writing English, and for whatever reason I like.  

God knows how many articles will be written in this section for I myself, am just trying to espouse my own ideas in English.

Maybe another reason of writing such part is,after reading few books in English and reciting thousands of words, it's time for me to improve my skill to another level, instead of staying in the old ways.  
Songs, books, talks, videos... things in English are all on my favorite spectrum.(?)  
Staying in the spelling stage is far from mastering English. Oral, writing, cultural things in English are also marvelous parts of English.  

Inevitably errors like grammar and words spelling will exist (hopefully sometimes) among these articles. I will greatly appreciate it if you leave some comments on it or correct them by e-mailing me. :)  

Here comes my recent book marks: Some excellent excerpts, ideas from famous people like Samuel Johnson, Bertrand Russell, Samuel Smiles,etc..


## An unseeming reason

I found my "super power" when I drove today. Robert Greene once said that concentration is the super power that everyone owns. Yep, I can't agree no more. Once you put absolutely focus on the thing you are working on, time flies by, until you are out of energy, or distracted by something cannot be ignored.  

Probably the hardest thing for us is not focusing on a task, but starting on, embarking on the task.Therefore,**DO IT FOR ONE MINUTE.** You will know whether the task is so difficult that you are downright refusing to do it.  
Take this moment for illustration. Writting in English seems hard for me in the beginning.Okay, whatever, I've already written things above. Yeahhhh, another success!
