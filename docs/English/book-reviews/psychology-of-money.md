## 没有人真的对钱失去理智
Two ways to make money: 
1. savings
2. investment

Two example for illustration:
1. A cleaner saved 8 million dollars at the end of his life, being a philanthropist and leaving 2 million to his family.
2. A rich person, buying assets with almost all his money, faced the financial crisis in 2008, and got broke immediately.  

Almost no other fields like finance can demonstrate such a huge gap between the rich and the poor.  
Instead of forecasting the market, we should review the history and observe what people do in such scenarios.    
Genius are those who can keep conscious and be clear on what to do when others are irrational.  

It's normal that people make decisions on spending money that is illogical for other people.  
But the truth is, **people decide on their own experience.**   
Never judge others easily based on what we see.   
One example is that, the mother of a friend, thought working in the factory(Foxconn), many many hours for a day, is more acceptable, even though most others think it's not.The reason is that, **she once worked in a brothel**.  
Working by hand ,comparing to selling her body, is more decent and acceptable.  

## 运气与风险
Bill Gates and his genius fellow Kent Evans.  
The former luckily got the chance to work with a computer, a rarity of that age, and finally built his company with such a rare opportunity.  
The latter, as smart as he is, lost his life in his early years in hiking experience.  

Luck and risk are two sides of the same coin.  
Ascribe to luck when success and never overlook the risk when failure.  
Never will you know that your success/ failure is due to the risk, or to the good/bad decisions you've made from the very beginning.   

## 永不知足
The way to be sure-win in the game of gambling, is to never start playing.  
It's out of mind that you lose with the bid of everything you have, and gain what you don't need with it.  
Show-hand is never a good choice when you are poor.

Another way of showing greed is that, though you might own things that others will never have in their rest life, what you want is never enough. Your eager will be doubled up until you get satisfied with what you already own.
