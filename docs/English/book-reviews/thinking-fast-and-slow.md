# Thinking Fast and Slow

To be a good diagnostician, a physician needs to acquire a large set of labels for diseases, each of which binds an idea of the illness and its symptoms, possible antecedents and casuses, possible developments and consequences, and possible interventions to cure or mitigate the illness.Same as for people's judgments and choices.  
要知道人们是怎样作出决策的,就要先知道如何用准确的术语,对这一过程进行恰当的描述.

Sytematic errors are known as biases, and they recur predictably in particular circumstances.  
关于直觉的偏见讨论.


Much of the discussion in this book is about biases of intuition.However, the focus on error does not denigrate humanintelligence, any more than the attention to diseases in medical texts denies good health.  
不知道医学术语不会影响人们的健康状态,不知道直觉偏见也不会影响人们的决策能力.  

The aim: imporve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them.  

Are people good intuitive statisticians?More likely, no.  

We documented systematic errors in the thinking of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by emotion.

Why some issues are highly salient in the public's mind while others are neglected?  
People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory -- and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.
