# Thinking badly? -- Or not thinking at all

Recording some sentences in two books -- **Thinking Clearly** , and **How to Think Differently**.  

By the moment of writing this artcle, I only have read two sections of each book.  
However, recording may count, which is better than doing nothing after reading the whole book.  
Therefore, this article may end at any time for reasons of forgetting to record, nothing impressionable to be marked, and not persitent enough to finish reading any of the books.  
Whatever it goes, I myself want to record what I've learned from the book at this moment.(Wrting such "nonsense" just works as a way to recall myself of using English recording.Hopefully I explained myself well. :)   )  

Think differently:
We all stereotype some times, consciously or unconciously.  
**"Believing is seeing"** -- We always see what we want to see, and filter out what we don't believe.Like any innovative ideas proposed at the first time, our first reactions may be rejecting it instead of thinking possibilities caused by the ideas.  
3 summary sentences in sector 1:  
* We see the world selectively: Seeing what we expect to see and hearing what we expect to hear;
* Our perceptions are based largely on past experience and conditioning;
* We often mistake our perceptions, our map of the world, for the world, and assume that others are working from the same map.

## What stops us from thinking clearly / rationally?
What touched me first is the question: Why we hope to think clearly?  
Do we always think badly? Or, do we actually "think", in most moments?  
Give a moment to such question.

Some "default" behaviors / biological instinctis, stop us from thinking clearly:
1. emotion default
2. ego default
3. social default
4. inertia default  

### Emotion Default
Under circumstances of anger, fear, anxiety,or time pressing, we tend to act biologically, without any thinking process.

### Ego Default
**Not all confidence is created equally.Sometimes, it comes from a track record of applying deep knowledge successfully, and other times it comes from the shallowness of reading an article.**  
Our ego tempts us into thinking we're more than we are.  
Unearned knowledge rushes us to judgement.    
We are sooooo confident that, bad luck will only happen to other people, and will never befall on us.(So, who's the "other person"?Neither you nor me.Who else then?)  
The ego default urges us to feel right at the expense of being right.(?)

### Social Default
**Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.**  
The scoial default inspires conformity. It coaxes us to fall in line with an idea or behavior simply because other people do.  
**Lemmings rarely make history.**  
"Only when the shovel comes along do others see its advantage."  

### Inertia Default
The inertia default pushes us to maintain the status quo.Starting something is hard but so too is stopping something. We resist change even when change is for the best.  

(Actuality perfectly met my expectations.Started up hard, diminished in the progress, ended up with nothing left...)
