#  Of Study
> After staying up late for two days, I wonder the meaning of playing games, as well as writing posts like this.  
> Playing games really makes me happy, for that very moments. What leaves on my mind, are those mind-invoking excerpts, like the following one. If I continue live on such "very" excitement, which lasts only for a short time,I'll absolutely fuck my life up.   
> Instant excitement seems intriguing, but what lasts long, are those content in books, and those skills which I live on.Playing games are definitely useless.  
> * 英文写了一串感觉也没表达自己想说的.简单说就是游戏都是即时娱乐,睡醒就忘了.通宵玩,不仅快乐没了,身体还累得不行.读书的意义就不同了,过了很久现在还是想摘抄到这里.读书时的想法,"自己不仅不会英文,读完这篇文章,连中文都不会了."  
> * 隔了一段时间又"间歇性热情"起来了.先摘抄吧.其实也不算摘抄,算转载了,verbatim.感觉都挺有意义的每句.每个词都懂,连在一起就不懂了.我要什么水平才能翻译出这样的中文呢?  
> * 哪个是自己的理解翻译,哪个是博士翻译应该一眼就能看出来.博士直接翻译出古文(没有就是没贴原翻译出来)了,没点水平都翻不出来.

**Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability.Their chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of business.**  
* 有的人读书为了取悦自己, 有的人为了提升气质谈吐, 有的人为了学习技能.
* 读书如饮水,冷暖自知; 气质提升,方能谈吐自然; 技能提升,则能在处事上批判进行.

* for ornament,原意作装饰用,但这里译为点缀谈吐.
* in privateness and retiring, retiring译为离群索居."于彼孤斋幽憩之日,书可怡情忘忧"
* for ornament,is in discourse; 高谈阔论之际,可缀饰言吐

**For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are learned.**
* 练达之人虽可按部就班,操持细务; 而至于运筹帷幄,统率全局,则非饱学之士不可为.  
::: info
看不出前半句的意思,以为前半句已经是夸赞话语了:能执行,能精准判断,难道不是在夸一个人吗?但这个but,结合翻译,又很合理.不得不服这篇文章中英水平都很高.  
* plots and marshalling, 被译为运筹帷幄,统率全局的人.

**To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament, is affectation; to make judgement wholly by their rules, is the humor of a study.**
* 埋首书本不问世事实为倦怠之举,满口华章彩辞者难免矫揉造作,食书不化按图索骥者乃是腐迂学究.
::: info
* 学而不用是为怠;一味展示才学是为"装",矫揉造作;一味依据已有规则进行判断,是为愚.(我也不知道理解对不对,意思是大概个意思)
* **sloth, affectation, humor of study.**
:::

**They (*Studies) perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning, by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience.**
* 盖天生资质若自然花木,饱学而后知修剪削删;
* 而若无阅历之铺,书中所示则大而无当,不足为用.  

::: info
* perfect作动词?读书补资质不足,阅历又补读书之不足.  
(阐明了理论和实践之间的关系:读书和实践相辅相成,实践是理论的基础,理论对实践具有指导作用.)

**Cratfy men condemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation.**
* 狡狯之人厌书,庸凡之群慕书,唯明智之士善用书.
* 个中智慧常在书外,善观察审度方能获取.(?这真是英语翻译出来的?)
* "知识本身并没有告诉人们怎样运用它,运用的智慧在书本之外.这是技艺,不体验就学不到."
::: info
* 自己翻译甚至不能理解整句话: 心意不纯者不屑于学习, 头脑简单者仰慕知识, 聪明之士利用知识.(后面???)
:::

**Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.**
* 读书切忌一味斥驳,更不可轻信盲从,亦不可只为寻章摘句,而宜衡情度理,推敲细思.
::: info
* find talk and discourse 译为寻章摘句(?)
:::

**Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested;**
* 书有可浅尝者,有可生吞者,有少数可细嚼慢咽、融会贯通者.(书的好坏的一个分类)

**that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.**
* 换言之,或宜览其枝叶,或宜察其大体,唯少数需细心凝神,精修研习.

**Some books also may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less important arguments, and the meaner sort of books, else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things.**
* 一些书可以听别人诠释,或是阅读他人的读书笔记.但仅在题材较次且价值不高者,否则书经提炼犹如水经蒸馏,寡淡无味.

妈耶,听书和"看评论"读书很好过滤掉大部分书.把我英译中的理念感受,类比到了亲自读书,和听书/看书的评论总结.能看到的都是二手理解了,好坏只有自己细心读下来才知是否准确.  
:::

**Reading makes a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.**
* 不看翻译完全理解不了的一句:"三个句子结构类似,谓语都是makes(???)"
* 读书使人渊博,辩谈使人机智,笔记使人精准.

**And therefore, if a man write a little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit; and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth not.**
* 是前面"三句"的一个展开和解释:  
    做笔记少的人,记忆力大概要求很好;不善辩论的人,大概需要天资聪颖; 而读书少的人,则需要"一点点"欺世之术,方能掩其无知本色.
* 结合了读书,谈话,笔记的联系.不绝对,但也不能说三者之间没有关系.

**Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtle; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend.**
* 谓语都是make的又一个例子来了,加上make,"使人变得xx"是否就能完整理解这句话呢?
* 读史使人明智,读诗使人秀敏,数学使人严谨,哲学使人深邃,伦理之书使人端庄,逻辑修辞使人善辩.

***Abeunt studia in mores*(Studies pass into and influence manners).**
* 凡有所学,皆成性格.(???)

**Nay, there is no stand or impediment in the wit but may be wrought out by fit studies; like as diseases of the body may have appropriate exercises.**
* 也是一个自己理解跟翻译完全不同的句子:
* 凡心智之阻障,咸可以适当之书化之,恰如体躯之疾瘎无不可以运动除之.

**Bowling is good for the stone and reins; shooting for the lungs and breast; gentle walking for the stomach; riding for the head; and the like.**
* 保龄健睾肾,射箭利心肺,散步清肠胃,骑术益大脑,无不如此.
* 对上一句的展开解释

**So if a man's wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics; for in demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so little, he must begin again.**
* wit wandering, be called away never so little: 结合一下就是数学需严谨,容不得一点细小错误,因此能解决"精神涣散"的问题.
* 若难以凝神自制,可令研习数学,盖推绎演算之时若有丝毫懈怠则前功尽弃.

**If his wit be not apt to distinguish or find differences, let him study the Schoolmen; for they are *cymini sectores*(splitters of hairs).**
* If... If...可以看出两句是同结构类比,意思可能不一,但表达的方式是一样的.
* 若拙于辨异,可读经院哲学,盖此辈皆吹毛求疵之人.  
哦哦哦哦哦哦!! splitters of hair, 每根头发都要细分出来的人,吹毛求疵之辈! 

**If he be not apt to beat over matters, and to call up one thing to prove and illustrate another, let him study the lawyers' cases. So every defect of the mind may have a special receipt.**
* 上面还没完,还有一个If... 解释完对症下药,药有所医这个概念
* 若不能触类旁通、举一反三,可令读律师案卷,是以心智之缺陷皆有良方可救.

## Sum up

1. para1, 学习的目的:乐趣,言谈,技能
2. para2, 理论与实践相辅相成
3. para3, 不同人对学习的不同态度,唯智者善用书籍
4. para4, 书分好坏,或以浅尝,或以细嚼.
5. para5, 读书,谈话,写作的关系.
6. para6, 书有不同类型;书有所医,用以治疗心理上的各种不足,恰如不同运动对身体各个部位的针对训练.
