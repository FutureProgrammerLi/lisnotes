> First try on the task, made by myself, keep working on things in English for 8 hours.  
Whatever it takes, give it a shot! :)

A paradox stroke me in the process of excerpting the following content:  
- Transcribing too much, makes me, TLDR, less prone to read in future for the content are too much.
- Too few, makes me wonder, what am I transcribing? Does it make their own sense? Is there enough sentences to make a context for understanding?  

The answer for the above paradox remains unknown. Alright, JUST DO THINGS and explore it.

## How should one read a book?
> Author: Virginia Woolf  
> A meaningful description of how to read a book, which leaves me a good impression on the whole book.  
> Elligible, thought-provoking and in easy words.   

* **The only advice, indeed, that one person can give another about reading is to take no advice, to follow your own instincts, to use your own reason, to come to your own conclusions.**  

People read for their own individual purposes.Some for entertainment, some for knowledge, and others for leisuring. Just do it for yourself but not others.  

* **If this is agreed between us, then I feel at liberty to put forward a few ideas and suggestions because you will not allow them to fetter that independence which is the most important quality that a reader can possess.**

Reading is an individual thing.It seems to be a common sense that, once you've chosen a book to read, then you are ready to open up your mind, accepting different views, from the author as well as other readers.They may contradict with your thoughts. But reading is just like that: regarding views from all different people.Absorb the good ones that apply to you, and expurgate but respect the bad ones.  

* **Everywhere else we may be bound by laws and conventions -- there we have none.**

* **Yet few people ask from books what books can give us.Most commonly we come to books with blurred and divided minds, asking of fiction that it shall be true, of poetry that it shall be false, of biography that it shall be flattering, of history that it shall enforce our own prejudices.**  

Many unrealistic prejudices exist in our mind. Banishing those prejudices is an admirable beginning when we read.

## Companionship of books
> Author: Samuel Smiles  

* **A good book may be among the best of friends. It is the same today as it always was, and it will never change. It is the most patient and cheerful of companions. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness, amusing and instructing us in youth, and comfroting and consoling us in age.**  

With good books, we get our best accompanied no matter what condition we are in. Perfect illustration of the importance of books.

* **Men often discover their affinity to each other by the love they have each for a book -- just as two persons sometimes discover a friend by the admiration which both have for a third.**  

Well stating that why books are as important as people accompanying in our life.  

* **"Books, wind into the heart; the poet's verse slides in the current of our blood.We read them when young, we remember them when old. We read there of what has happened to others, we feel that it has happened to ourselves. They are to be had everywhere cheap and good. We breathe but the air of books."**

Get tired of writing comments on each paras... Try in words as simple as possible.  
Why books are nutrient for us: We read when young, we remember when old. What we've read slides in our blood.  

* **A good book is often the best urn of a life enshrining the best that life could think out.**  

Sentences may be simple in any books.But actually, they can be a life frution of the intellectual.

* **The good and true thought may in times of temptaion be as an angel of mercy purifying and guarding the soul. It also enshrines the germs of action, for good words almost always inspire to good works.**

* **Temples and statues decay, but books survive. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their authors' mind, ages ago.**  

* **The only effect of time has been to sift out the bad products; for nothing in literature can long survive but what is really good.**

Through reading, we can trascend time and space, getting into a brand new world with the guidance of the author.

## On Idleness
> Author: Samuel Johnson

* **Pride lies hidden under the greatest variety of disguises; of disguises, which like the moon's veil of brightness, and both its luster and its shade, and betray it to others, though they hide it from ourselves.**  

Liken pride to the two facets of the moon, demonstrating the bad and good parts of Pride.

* **There are some that profess Idleness in its full dignity,who call themselves the Idle; ... who boast that they do nothing, and thank their stars that they have nothing to do; who sleep every night till they can sleep longer and rise only that exercise may enable them to sleep again; who prolong the reign of darkness by double curtains, and never see the sun but to tell him how they hate his beams; whose whole labor is to vary the postures of indulgence and whose day differs from their night but as a couch or chair differs from a bed.**  

Long enough huh? Vidvidly demonstrating "the Idle", do nothing and rationalize their behaviors with "righteous, virtuous" excuses.  

* **These are true and open votaries of Idleness, for whome she weaves the garlands of poppies, and into whose cup she pours the waters of oblivion; who exist in a state of unruffled stupidity, forgetting and forgotten; who have long ceased to live, and at whose death the survivors can only say, that they have ceased to breath.**

No words can better describing the idle:   
They have long ceased to live, and at whose deatch the survivors can only say, that they ceased to breath! ceased to breath! ceased to breath! hahahahahaha!

* **Idleness is a silent and peaceful quality that neither raises envy by ostentation, nor hatred by opposition; and therefore nobody is busy to censure or detect it.**

* **Nothing is to be expected from the workman whose tools are forever to be sought.No man ever excelled in painting, who was eminently curious about pencils and colors.**
