# "IT"

> "The feeling of importance"    
是一篇随记,也可以说是<人性的弱点>的一篇读书笔记.  
又开始读了这书,怎么感觉跟新书一样???我不是读过中文版吗??  


先回答一下早上读的时候,留给自己的一些问题吧,也是一些个人觉得比较touching的英文句子.
* Why some people go insane?
    <p class="font-bold text-red-600 font-sans">: "Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality;but in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity, all her barkenitines race into port with canvas billowing and winds winging through the masts."</p>
    <p>'If I could stretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I wouldn't do it.She's much happier as she is'</p>
    当梦想的船一只只沉没于现实之海,幻想的港口是否愿意收留我们.(我们可以投靠的,是否只有幻想的港湾?)

    人间清醒的人,是否就比精神病人活得更快乐呢?(...无端猜想,怎么英语用了点点修辞就能把我感动到稀里哗啦的...)

* Why Schwab was able to be so successful according to his words?(原文是怎么修饰他如何成功的一段回复的?怎么体现一段话的重要性?)  
    <p class='font-bold text-red-600'>Here is his secret set down in his own words - words that ought to be cast in eternal bronze and hung in every home and school, every shop and office in the land -words that children ought to memorise instead of wasting their time memorising the conjugation of Latin verbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in Brazil -words that will all but transfrom your life and mine if we will only live them.</p>
    "刻在铜字里流芳百世,挂在每家每户,每所学校,商铺,办公室.与其死记硬背怎么用单词,巴西年降雨量,不如记这段话.如果你想改变自己生活的话,就记这段话."(...塑料翻译,意会不可言传嗯)  

    顺便这段话的"words"就是以下:(大概意思,仅以避免自己不知道结果的难受感):  
    "Arouse enthusiasm among people.<i>I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.</i>"

* Andrew Carnegie的epitaph是什么意思?  
    "Here lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself."  
    "Here lies a man who was able to surround himself with men far cleverer than himself."  
    是的,他为自己写的"墓志铭"?也在夸赞他身边的人."我之所以成功,是因为身边都是比我更加聪明的人."!!!!天啊...

* 作者举例,一位丈夫是如何夸赞他的妻子的?  
    起因: "Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six things I would like to change about her-my heavens, she could have listed a thousand things she would like to change about me-but I didn't."  
    "Let me think about it and give you an answer in the morning."  
    我想她改变的,只需列出六件事--太棒了.  她想我改变的,哪怕有几百上千条--随便,反正我也不会改.(好对比!好押韵!好!)  
    <p class='font-bold text-red-600'>丈夫的回答,(早起买了六朵玫瑰,并留下纸条):"I can't think of six things I would like to change about you.I love you the way you are"</p>  
    <p class='text-xs text-blue-300 font-bold'>啊啊啊啊好会啊啊啊啊啊,要有怎样的修行才能做到这样的境界."求生之路"笑死我了</p>

* 标题的"it"是什么意思?代指什么?  
    "Arouse in the other person an eager want.He who can do this has the whole world with him.He who cannot walks a lonely way."  
    是第三章的内容.阿?这章都看完了怎么记得的内容全是第二章的?(上面的全是第二章的.Complement and praises.)
